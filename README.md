# Quasar App (quasar-metro-ui)

A Quasar Framework app

## What is Metro UI?

Metro UI is an interface pattern originally designed by Microsoft for the Windows Phone. The phone today is dead but the design is timeless. Metro UI is essentially made out of **Card Elements** which can be integrated together to form part of a touch screen interface like a dashboard. This application explores the concept further.
